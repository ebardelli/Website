  abstract = {For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages in high-needs areas (HNAs), including science, mathematics, and special education, as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit HNA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee, we observe that the number of teachers who receive HNA endorsements has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNA teachers have similar student achievement gains as non-HNA teachers. Though HNA and non-HNA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM and special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Overall, findings suggest that efforts in Tennessee to recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with HNA endorsements have mostly been successful.},

observational research has found that more effective mentors and schools with better professional
climates are associated with better preparation for teacher candidates. We test these findings using an
experimental assignment of teacher candidates to placement sites in two states. Candidates who were
randomly assigned to higher quality placement sites experienced larger improvements in performance
over the course of the clinical experience, as evaluated by university instructors. The findings suggest that
improving clinical placement procedures can improve the teaching quality of candidates.},

  abstract = {Prior work suggests that recent graduates from teacher education programs
feel better prepared to teach and are more instructionally effective when
they learned to teach with more instructionally effective cooperating
teachers. However, we do not know if these relationships are causal. Even
if they are, we do not know if it is possible to recruit cooperating
teachers who are, on average, significantly more effective than those
currently serving. This paper describes an innovative strategy to use
historical administrative on teachers to recommend the most
instructionally effective teachers in various districts and subject areas
to serve as cooperating teachers. In collaboration with a large teacher
education program, partnering districts were randomized to receive either
recommendation lists or use business-as-usual approaches. Those districts
that received recommendations recruited significantly and meaningfully
more effective and experienced cooperating teachers. Additionally,
preservice student teachers who learned to teach in these same districts
felt significantly better prepared to teach. This study offers an
innovative and low-cost strategy for recruiting effective and experienced
cooperating teachers and presents some of the first evidence that learning
to teach with instructionally effective cooperating teachers has a causal
impact on feelings of preparedness to teach.},

  abstract = {Value-added (VA) scores signal teacher quality and are designed to be
used, with other data, to make employment decisions. However, this
usefulness is hampered by: 1) their normative nature, which promotes
competition among teachers, 2) their difficulty to interpret and
incorporate with other data, which makes using VA scores as one data
source among many difficult, and 3) a lack of trust in scores. We show how
to create (model-based) non-normative and more interpretable VA scores,
which winds up being a simple rescaling of traditional VA scores. Our
approach more closely links VA scores to data-based decision making
efforts and enables the creation of clear and objective criterion of
effectiveness for teachers.},
