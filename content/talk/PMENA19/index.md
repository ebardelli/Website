# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Technology-mediated simulations of teaching practice are becoming a more common way to introduce teachers to the dilemmas of teaching during professional development. In this paper, we show that the inclusion of markers of student emotions in cartoon-based scenarios of teaching changes teachersâ€™ appropriateness rating of the actions that the teacher took in the storyboard. Our results show that the inclusion of markers of student emotions in representations of practice could cue teachers into a particular judgments of action."
