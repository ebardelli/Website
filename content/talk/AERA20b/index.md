While mathematics content courses are expected to provide future teachers with
the needed content knowledge to become an effective educator, little is known
about the effects of these courses on content knowledge development. In this
paper, we report on the outcomes for 222 students from 13 Geometry for
Teachers courses taken across the United States. We find that completing this
course is positively associated with a growth in MKT-G scores similar to the
growth in MKT-G scores that we would expect between the first and second year
of experience teaching geometry. We also observe that these positive results
are concentrated with course completers who are interested in pursuing a
secondary mathematics teacher certification.
