# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Evaluating the Quality of Instruction in Post-secondary Mathematics (EQIPM) is a video coding instrument that provides indicators of the quality of instruction in community college algebra lessons. It grew out of two instruments that assess the quality of instruction in K-12 settingsâ€”the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) instrument (Hill, 2014) and the Quality of Instructional Practices in Algebra (QIPA) instrument (Litke, 2015). We present preliminary results of an exploratory factor analysis that suggests that the instrument captures three distinct dimensions of quality of instruction in community college algebra classes."
