However, our research partners have reported that recruitment of experienced teachers has become increasingly difficult in their state because of concerns around negative effects of being a cooperating teacher on evaluation metrics. We find that teachersâ€™ observation rating increase and that value-added scores do not change in years that teachers serve as CTs."
