I am a doctoral candidate in Educational Studies at the University of Michigan and an IES predoctoral fellow.  My research interests include teacher professional development, teacher learning, and instructional practices in mathematics education.

My dissertation focuses on the instructional supports that mathematics teachers experience at the beginning of their careers and their relationship with instructional growth and employment decisions.

Originally from Italy, I earned a bachelor of science in mathematics from the Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, and a master of arts in education and a teaching credential from California State University, Los Angeles.  Before beginning my PhD program, I worked both as an instructional coach and as a middle and high school mathematics teacher in Los Angeles and Lodi, California for five years.

I use the pronouns he, him, his.
