abstract = "There is growing interest in the field of education for leveraging emerging digital technologies to support teachers' learning in online or blended settings. This paper builds on Clarke and Hollingsworth's (2002) Interconnected Model of Professional Growth by investigating an alternative instantiation of professional experimentation. In particular, we examine the StoryCircles model of professional development (Herbst & Milewski, 2018), which ushers teachers into a simulated type of professional experimentation to support teacher growth through the design and improvement of lessons using storyboards. In that context, we investigate how StoryCircles enable teachers to experiment professionally in a virtual space. Focusing on the experiences of two secondary mathematics teachers, we illustrate how the StoryCircles processes of scripting and argumentation were associated with teacher growth. We discuss how the Clarke and Hollingsworth (2002) Interconnected Model of Professional Growth can be useful for the design and study of simulated professional experimentation."
