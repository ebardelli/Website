 abstract = { Value-added (VA) scores signal teacher quality and are designed to be used, with other data, to make employment decisions. However, this usefulness is hampered by: 1) their normative nature, which promotes competition among teachers, 2) their difficulty to interpret and incorporate with other data, which makes using VA scores as one data source among many difficult, and 3) a lack of trust in scores. We show how to create (model-based) non-normative and more interpretable VA scores, which winds up being a simple rescaling of traditional VA scores. Our approach more closely links VA scores to data-based decision making efforts and enables the creation of clear and objective criterion of effectiveness for teachers.},
