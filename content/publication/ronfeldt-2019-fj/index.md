abstract = "Growing evidence suggests that preservice candidatesreceive better coaching and are more instructionally effectivewhen they are mentored by more instructionally effective cooperating teachers (CTs). Yet, teacher education program leaders indicate it is difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachersto serve as CTs, in part because they worry that serving may negatively impact district evaluation scores. Using a unique dataset on over 4,500 CTs, we compare evaluation scores during years these teachers served as CTs to yearsthey did not. In years they served as CTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat better achievement gains, though not always at significant levels.These results suggest that concerns overlowered evaluations should not prevent teachers from serving as CTs."
