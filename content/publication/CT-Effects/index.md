# Abstract.
abstract = "Growing evidence suggeststhat preservice candidatesreceive better coaching and are more instructionally effectivewhen they are mentored by more instructionally effective cooperating teachers(CTs).Yet, teacher education programleadersindicate it is difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachersto serve asCTs, in part because they worry that serving maynegatively impact district evaluation scores. Using aunique dataset onover 4,500CTs,we compare evaluation scores during years these teachers served asCTsto yearsthey did not.In yearsthey served asCTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat better achievement gains, though not always atsignificantlevels.These results suggestthat concerns overlowered evaluationsshould not preventteachers from serving as CTs."
