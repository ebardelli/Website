  Abstract
                  <p>The use of artifacts to introduce the distributive law of multiplication over addition in primary school is a diffused approach: it is possible to find pre-constructed learning trajectories in instructional materials. However, it is still unclear how the teacher might support his/her students in transitioning from concrete to symbolic representations of the distributive law. In the theoretical frame of the Theory of Semiotic Mediation, we report on a study where Laisant’s table, an artifact embodying the rectangular model of multiplication, is used to introduce distributive law in second grade. Taking a microanalytical approach, we show how a group of students connects the representation provided by the artifact with the symbolic representation of the arithmetic property (as equivalence of numerical sentences). Two different semiotic chains are identified and presented, showing the continuity between the activity with the artifact and the mathematical signs emerging in following activities and promoted by tasks specifically designed. The role of the teacher in triggering and scaffolding this process is highlighted.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This case study explored Prospective Elementary Mathematics Specialists’ (PEMSs) pedagogical practices during a K-5 Mathematics Endorsement (K-5 ME) program, specifically focusing on the authentic residency with mentor sessions. Participants included nine PEMSs, with qualitative and quantitative data collected via individual interviews, professional portfolios, and observations of classroom practices. Upon completion of the K-5 ME program, all participants were implementing instructional practices learned about in the program in substantial ways. Participants were honing their skills for orchestrating effective discourse, and the application of those skills became more meaningful as they saw the impact it was having on student learning. This implementation and documentation program coursework was rigorous as PEMSs worked to develop themselves as mathematics teachers and teacher leaders. The collaborative support during the authentic residency and mentor sessions seem to have been significant for PEMSs in supporting implementation of newly learned instructional practices. Ultimately, PEMSs completed the program feeling more prepared as elementary mathematics teachers and teacher leaders.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Volume 49, Issue 3, Page 220-223, April 2020. <br>In this brief, we examine an important but obscure form of state spending on K–12 education—state subsidies of school district pension costs. In 2018, this exceeded $19 billion across 23 states. To put that amount into perspective, 2018 federal spending on Title I programs was $15.8 billion. This revenue stream is often ignored in analyses of state aid for K–12 and its distribution across districts. Until recently, accounting standards did not require pension plans to report these implicit subsidies to the school districts, so they did not typically know the size of their subsidy. In some important cases, it was missing from state totals for education aid. In the first comprehensive tabulation of these data, we show that this subsidy can be as much as $2,400 per pupil, as it is in Connecticut. In Illinois, it comprises an additional 56% of state spending on K–12 on top of all formula and categorical aid.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Schools are heralded by some as unique sites for promoting racial equity. Central to this characterization is the presumption that teachers embrace racial equity and teaching about this topic. In contrast, others have documented the ongoing role of teachers in perpetuating racial inequality in schools. In this article, we employ data from two national data sets to investigate teachers’ explicit and implicit racial bias, comparing them to adults with similar characteristics. We find that both teachers and nonteachers hold pro-White explicit and implicit racial biases. Furthermore, differences between teachers and nonteachers were negligible or insignificant. The findings suggest that if schools are to effectively promote racial equity, teachers should be provided with training to either shift or mitigate the effects of their own racial biases.

  Abstract
                  <p>We expand on prior qualitative research about mathematics identity development using data from a large national US survey of 10,437 students in 336 college calculus classes. Multinomial logistic regression models find that a stronger mathematics identity predicts higher student interest in pursuing certain STEM careers when compared with non-STEM careers, particularly those in physical and computer sciences, engineering, and mathematics, or in science or mathematics teaching. Multiple linear regression models identify that certain instructional practices employed by high school mathematics teachers predict higher levels of students’ mathematics identity. These include a high amount of interaction within the classroom, a focus on mathematics connections, and activities involving conceptual learning. Surprisingly, the role of the textbook, ways of organizing students (individual, small group, whole class), forms of assessment, and use of calculators or computers did not significantly predict students’ mathematics identity.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 6, Issue 2, April-June 2020. <br>Teacher collaboration is often assumed to support school’s ongoing improvement, but it is unclear how formal learning opportunities in teacher workgroups shape informal ones. In this mixed methods study, we examined 77 teacher collaborative meetings from 24 schools representing 116 teacher pairs. We coupled qualitative analysis of the learning opportunities in formal meetings with quantitative analysis of teachers’ advice-seeking ties in informal social networks. We found that teachers’ coparticipation in learning-rich, high-depth meetings strongly predicted the formation of new advice-seeking ties. What is more, these new informal ties were linked to growth in teachers’ expertise, pointing to added value of teachers’ participation in high-depth teacher collaboration.

  AERA Open, Volume 6, Issue 2, April-June 2020. <br>This article shows that the traditional narrative of Black-White high school graduation gaps is inverted among economically disadvantaged female students. Two nationally representative surveys and statewide administrative data demonstrate that low-income White females graduate at rates 5 to 6 percentage points lower than Black peers despite having higher test scores. Greater rates of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use among White females account for one third of the attainment disparity. Since the early onset of substance use among low-income White females predicts lower attainment, more research on the factors leading to risky behaviors and their correlates during early adolescence is warranted. Examining racial gaps in high school graduation at the intersection of gender and income categories can inform more tailored interventions.

  Abstract
                  <p>Many of the methods commonly used to research mathematical practice, such as analyses of historical episodes or individual cases, are particularly well-suited to generating causal hypotheses, but less well-suited to testing causal hypotheses. In this paper we reflect on the contribution that the so-called hypothetico-deductive method, with a particular focus on experimental studies, can make to our understanding of mathematical practice. By way of illustration, we report an experiment that investigated how mathematicians attribute aesthetic properties to mathematical proofs. We demonstrate that perceptions of the aesthetic properties of mathematical proofs are, in some cases at least, subject to social influence. Specifically, we show that mathematicians’ aesthetic judgements tend to conform to the judgements made by others. Pedagogical implications are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Two different tools for assessing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of mathematics teachers used in the framework of the COACTIV study are systematically compared in this paper, namely the paper-and-pencil test consisting of items on the three facets knowledge of explaining and representation, knowledge of student thinking and typical mistakes, and knowledge of the potential of mathematical tasks, and the video vignettes instrument that examines teachers' proposed continuations for presented lesson video clips specific to their subject-related and methodological competence aspects. Initially, both COACTIV PCK assessment tools are systematically contrasted for the first time with respect to their predictive validity for instructional quality (N = 163 German secondary mathematics teachers) as well as student learning gains (N = 3806 PISA students from 169 different classes) by means of path models showing that PCK, when assessed by the paper-and-pencil method, can better predict instructional quality than the video vignettes instrument can. Next, we theoretically propose the cascade model as capable of integrating pertinent theories on teacher competence and instructional quality. This model implies five ‘columns’ that are ordered according to a sequential causal chain (teacher disposition → situation-specific skills → observable teaching behavior → student mediation → learning gains). Finally, we specify four out of the five ‘columns’ of this cascade model, based empirically on the COACTIV data.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This narrative and integrative literature review synthesizes the literature on when, where, and how the faculty hiring process used in most American higher education settings operates with implicit and cognitive bias. The literature review analyzes the “four phases” of the faculty hiring process, drawing on theories from behavioral economics and social psychology. The results show that although much research establishes the presence of bias in hiring, relatively few studies examine interventions or “nudges” that might be used to mitigate bias and encourage the recruitment and hiring of faculty identified as women and/or faculty identified as being from an underrepresented minority group. This article subsequently makes recommendations for historical, quasi-experimental, and randomized studies to test hiring interventions with larger databases and more controlled conditions than have previously been used, with the goal of establishing evidence-based practices that contribute to a more inclusive hiring process and a more diverse faculty.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>We address measurement error bias in propensity score (PS) analysis due to covariates that are latent variables. In the setting where latent covariate X is measured via multiple error-prone items W, PS analysis using several proxies for X—the W items themselves, a summary score (mean/sum of the items), or the conventional factor score (i.e., predicted value of X based on the measurement model)—often results in biased estimation of the causal effect because balancing the proxy (between exposure conditions) does not balance X. We propose an improved proxy: the conditional mean of X given the combination of W, the observed covariates Z, and exposure A, denoted [math]. The theoretical support is that balancing [math] (e.g., via weighting or matching) implies balancing the mean of X. For a latent X, we estimate [math] by the inclusive factor score (iFS)—predicted value of X from a structural equation model that captures the joint distribution of [math] given Z. Simulation shows that PS analysis using the iFS substantially improves balance on the first five moments of X and reduces bias in the estimated causal effect. Hence, within the proxy variables approach, we recommend this proxy over existing ones. We connect this proxy method to known results about valid weighting/matching functions. We illustrate the method in handling latent covariates when estimating the effect of out-of-school suspension on risk of later police arrests using National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>In continuous testing programs, some items are repeatedly used across test administrations, and statistical methods are often used to evaluate whether items become compromised due to examinees’ preknowledge. In this study, we proposed a residual method to detect compromised items when a test can be partitioned into two subsets of items: secure items and possibly compromised items. We derived the standard error of the residual statistic by taking the sampling error in both ability and item parameter estimate into account. The simulation results suggest that the Type I error is close to the nominal level when both sources of error are adjusted, and item parameter error can be ignored only when the item calibration sample size is much larger than the evaluation sample size. We also investigated the performance of the residual method when not using information from secure items in both simulation and real data analyses.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Affirmative action was banned in California, Texas, Washington, and Florida in the 1990s. Following this early wave, additional states banned the practice, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma. In response to concerns about underrepresented minorities’ falling college enrollment in flagship public universities, administrators and policymakers took a variety of steps to mitigate these declines. This article assesses the long-run changes in the racial and ethnic composition of selected universities after these bans. We find that the elimination of affirmative action has led to persistent declines in the share of underrepresented minorities among students admitted to and enrolling in public flagship universities in these states. These results imply that alternative policies and administrative decisions were unable to fully replace race-based affirmative action. Furthermore, we show that the antecedent conditions have only modestly improved in recent decades, suggesting that policymakers and administrators need to focus on improving these conditions.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing body of research evaluates the effects of turnaround on chronically low-performing schools. We extend this literature by formally testing factors that may either mediate or suppress the effects of two turnaround initiatives in Tennessee: the Achievement School District (ASD) and local Innovation Zones (iZones). Using difference-in-differences models within a mediational framework, we find that hiring effective teachers and principals partially explains positive iZone effects. In the ASD, high levels of teacher turnover suppress potential positive effects. Also, in iZone schools, increased levels of student mobility and chronic absenteeism suppress potentially larger positive effects. Policies that increase capacity within turnaround schools, such as financial incentives for effective staff, appear to be important ingredients for realizing positive effects from turnaround reforms.

  Abstract
                  <p>This survey paper examines selected issues related to the intersection of three broad scholarly areas: numeracy, adult education, and vulnerability. Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life, and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy, focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic, and workplace numeracy), literacy–numeracy linkages, functional and critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices, and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable. The closing section summarizes conclusions and research directions regarding the intersection of the three core domains. Overall, the paper points to emerging research needs and educational challenges that are relevant to scholars, practitioners, and policy makers interested in developing the numeracy of adults as well as in the mathematics education of younger learners.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study compares web usage data with interviews from 41 participants, who are members of an online professional development site called the Everyday Mathematics Virtual Learning Community (VLC), to explore how elementary school teachers learn from classroom video. Web usage data reveal that the commentary surrounding video posted to the VLC is sparse and surface level, possibly indicating a lack of serious attention to the videos. Interview data, however, indicate that participants felt they learned from this resource. Participants reported that the videos provided them with the opportunity to view and reflect on model lessons, plan curricula, and consider student thinking, among other learning outcomes. Participants also identified key factors that prevented them from posting comments to the site to convey their learning. These results can be used to understand not only how teachers perceive their own learning from classroom video, but also to redesign online professional development experiences to promote expression of that learning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper makes a case for placing knowledge at the centre of the school mathematics curriculum, and for knowledge building and knowledge differentiation as critical for both equity and excellence, emphasising that knowledge is much more than a set of descriptions of content as might typically be found in a curriculum document or textbook. The paper commences by discussing the implications of the traditional epistemological view of knowledge as justified true belief for mathematics education and uses this to build a preliminary description of knowledge building. Ideas from critical realism are then used to show that it is not so much the content of knowledge that matters but the production of knowledge and to build an enhanced conception of knowledge building in school mathematics. A distinction is made between knowledge and knowing that provides a non-relativist yet fallible view of knowledge, recognising its emergent but directed nature through its production and legitimation within established fields. The importance of knowledge building as a democratic right is then discussed, highlighting the importance of specialised knowledge and arguing that knowledge differentiation provides a basis for a conception of school mathematics curriculum that is dynamic and empowering. The paper concludes by discussing a range of potential theoretical and empirical research projects arising from a focus on knowledge and knowledge building in school mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study we investigated the development of 245 kindergarteners’ mathematics problem solving (MPS) at two time points within 7 months using a cognitive diagnostic test, which measured three cognitive components (mathematical knowledge and skills, semantic understanding, and quantitative reasoning) with eleven cognitive attributes. The effects of five influencing factors [language ability, mathematics application ability, calculation ability, approaches to learning (ATL) and socio-economic status (SES)] on the children’s MPS ability at the two time points were examined. The results indicated that the 245 children’s mastery of mathematical knowledge and skills was much better than their mastery of semantic understanding and quantitative reasoning. Furthermore, they achieved significant progress in set comparison and addition and subtraction within the range of natural numbers to ten (two of the three cognitive attributes of mathematical knowledge and skills), additive composition reasoning and one-to-many correspondence reasoning (two of the three cognitive attributes of quantitative reasoning). Only their mathematics application ability significantly predicted their mastery of the three cognitive components of MPS ability at the two-time points. Their language and calculation abilities predicted only their mastery of mathematical knowledge and skills at the two time points. Their ATL predicted their mastery of the three cognitive components of MPS only at the first time point, and their SES predicted only their mastery of semantic understanding 7 months later.</p>

We begin by describing a model that specifies how various cognitive resources, including working memory, contribute to individual differences in word-problem solving and by then summarizing findings on the relation between working memory and word-problem solving. This sets the context for the article’s main purpose and major section: to describe the findings of research studies that take one of two approaches for addressing the needs of students with low working memory within word-problem solving intervention. One approach focuses on compensating for working memory limitations; the other on building working memory capacity. We then suggest the need for research on integrating the two approaches by embedding working memory training within explicit word-problem solving intervention.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Language plays an important role in word problem solving. Accordingly, the language in which a word problem is presented could affect its solution process. In particular, East-Asian, non-alphabetic languages are assumed to provide specific benefits for mathematics compared to Indo-European, alphabetic languages. By analyzing students’ eye movements in a cross-linguistic comparative study, we analyzed word problem solving processes in Chinese and German. 72 German and 67 Taiwanese undergraduate students solved PISA word problems in their own language. Results showed differences in eye movements of students, between the two languages. Moreover, independent cluster analyses revealed three clusters of reading patterns based on eye movements in both languages. Corresponding reading patterns emerged in both languages that were similarly and significantly associated with performance and motivational-affective variables. They explained more variance among students in these variables than between the languages alone. Our analyses show that eye movements of students during reading differ between the two languages, but very similar reading patterns exist in both languages. This result supports the assumption that the language alone is not a sufficient explanation for differences in students’ mathematical achievement, but that reading patterns are more strongly related to performance.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematization is critical in providing students with challenges for solving modelling tasks. Inadequate assumptions in a modelling task lead to an inadequate situational model, and to an inadequate mathematical model for the problem situation. However, the role of assumptions in solving modelling problems has been investigated only rarely. In this study, we intentionally designed two types of assumptions in two modelling tasks, namely, one task that requires non-numerical assumptions only and another that requires both non-numerical and numerical assumptions. Moreover, conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge are also two factors influencing students’ modelling performance. However, current studies comparing modelling performance between Western and non-Western students do not consider the differences in students’ knowledge. This gap in research intrigued us and prompted us to investigate whether Taiwanese students can still perform better than German students if students’ mathematical knowledge in solving modelling tasks is differentiated. The results of our study showed that the Taiwanese students had significantly higher mathematical knowledge than did the German students with regard to either conceptual knowledge or procedural knowledge. However, if students of both countries were on the same level of mathematical knowledge, the German students were found to have higher modelling performance compared to the Taiwanese students in solving the same modelling tasks, whether such tasks required non-numerical assumptions only, or both non-numerical and numerical assumptions. This study provides evidence that making assumptions is a strength of German students compared to Taiwanese students. Our findings imply that Western mathematics education may be more effective in improving students’ ability to solve holistic modelling problems.</p>
