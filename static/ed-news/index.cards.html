  Abstract
                  <p>Many of the methods commonly used to research mathematical practice, such as analyses of historical episodes or individual cases, are particularly well-suited to generating causal hypotheses, but less well-suited to testing causal hypotheses. In this paper we reflect on the contribution that the so-called hypothetico-deductive method, with a particular focus on experimental studies, can make to our understanding of mathematical practice. By way of illustration, we report an experiment that investigated how mathematicians attribute aesthetic properties to mathematical proofs. We demonstrate that perceptions of the aesthetic properties of mathematical proofs are, in some cases at least, subject to social influence. Specifically, we show that mathematicians’ aesthetic judgements tend to conform to the judgements made by others. Pedagogical implications are discussed.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This narrative and integrative literature review synthesizes the literature on when, where, and how the faculty hiring process used in most American higher education settings operates with implicit and cognitive bias. The literature review analyzes the “four phases” of the faculty hiring process, drawing on theories from behavioral economics and social psychology. The results show that although much research establishes the presence of bias in hiring, relatively few studies examine interventions or “nudges” that might be used to mitigate bias and encourage the recruitment and hiring of faculty identified as women and/or faculty identified as being from an underrepresented minority group. This article subsequently makes recommendations for historical, quasi-experimental, and randomized studies to test hiring interventions with larger databases and more controlled conditions than have previously been used, with the goal of establishing evidence-based practices that contribute to a more inclusive hiring process and a more diverse faculty.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>In continuous testing programs, some items are repeatedly used across test administrations, and statistical methods are often used to evaluate whether items become compromised due to examinees’ preknowledge. In this study, we proposed a residual method to detect compromised items when a test can be partitioned into two subsets of items: secure items and possibly compromised items. We derived the standard error of the residual statistic by taking the sampling error in both ability and item parameter estimate into account. The simulation results suggest that the Type I error is close to the nominal level when both sources of error are adjusted, and item parameter error can be ignored only when the item calibration sample size is much larger than the evaluation sample size. We also investigated the performance of the residual method when not using information from secure items in both simulation and real data analyses.

  Abstract
                  <p>This survey paper examines selected issues related to the intersection of three broad scholarly areas: numeracy, adult education, and vulnerability. Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life, and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy, focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic, and workplace numeracy), literacy–numeracy linkages, functional and critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices, and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable. The closing section summarizes conclusions and research directions regarding the intersection of the three core domains. Overall, the paper points to emerging research needs and educational challenges that are relevant to scholars, practitioners, and policy makers interested in developing the numeracy of adults as well as in the mathematics education of younger learners.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper makes a case for placing knowledge at the centre of the school mathematics curriculum, and for knowledge building and knowledge differentiation as critical for both equity and excellence, emphasising that knowledge is much more than a set of descriptions of content as might typically be found in a curriculum document or textbook. The paper commences by discussing the implications of the traditional epistemological view of knowledge as justified true belief for mathematics education and uses this to build a preliminary description of knowledge building. Ideas from critical realism are then used to show that it is not so much the content of knowledge that matters but the production of knowledge and to build an enhanced conception of knowledge building in school mathematics. A distinction is made between knowledge and knowing that provides a non-relativist yet fallible view of knowledge, recognising its emergent but directed nature through its production and legitimation within established fields. The importance of knowledge building as a democratic right is then discussed, highlighting the importance of specialised knowledge and arguing that knowledge differentiation provides a basis for a conception of school mathematics curriculum that is dynamic and empowering. The paper concludes by discussing a range of potential theoretical and empirical research projects arising from a focus on knowledge and knowledge building in school mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The focus of this article is the well documented association between low working memory capacity and difficulty with mathematical word-problem solving. We begin by describing a model that specifies how various cognitive resources, including working memory, contribute to individual differences in word-problem solving and by then summarizing findings on the relation between working memory and word-problem solving. This sets the context for the article’s main purpose and major section: to describe the findings of research studies that take one of two approaches for addressing the needs of students with low working memory within word-problem solving intervention. One approach focuses on compensating for working memory limitations; the other on building working memory capacity. We then suggest the need for research on integrating the two approaches by embedding working memory training within explicit word-problem solving intervention.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematization is critical in providing students with challenges for solving modelling tasks. Inadequate assumptions in a modelling task lead to an inadequate situational model, and to an inadequate mathematical model for the problem situation. However, the role of assumptions in solving modelling problems has been investigated only rarely. In this study, we intentionally designed two types of assumptions in two modelling tasks, namely, one task that requires non-numerical assumptions only and another that requires both non-numerical and numerical assumptions. Moreover, conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge are also two factors influencing students’ modelling performance. However, current studies comparing modelling performance between Western and non-Western students do not consider the differences in students’ knowledge. This gap in research intrigued us and prompted us to investigate whether Taiwanese students can still perform better than German students if students’ mathematical knowledge in solving modelling tasks is differentiated. The results of our study showed that the Taiwanese students had significantly higher mathematical knowledge than did the German students with regard to either conceptual knowledge or procedural knowledge. However, if students of both countries were on the same level of mathematical knowledge, the German students were found to have higher modelling performance compared to the Taiwanese students in solving the same modelling tasks, whether such tasks required non-numerical assumptions only, or both non-numerical and numerical assumptions. This study provides evidence that making assumptions is a strength of German students compared to Taiwanese students. Our findings imply that Western mathematics education may be more effective in improving students’ ability to solve holistic modelling problems.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Students in the elementary grades often experience difficulty setting up and solving word problems. Using an equation to represent the structure of the problem serves as an effective tool for solving word problems, but students may require specific pre-algebraic reasoning instruction about the equal sign as a relational symbol to set up and solve such equations successfully. We identified students with mathematics difficulty (n = 138) from a sample of 916 third-grade students. We randomly assigned students to a word-problem intervention with a pre-algebraic reasoning component, a word-problem intervention without pre-algebraic reasoning, or the business-as-usual. Students in the 2 active intervention conditions participated in 45 individual sessions and learned about 3 additive word-problem schemas. Students who received word-problem intervention with a pre-algebraic reasoning component demonstrated improved nonstandard equation solving, equal sign understanding, and word-problem solving compared to students in the other two conditions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper presents the second phase of a larger research program with the purpose of exploring the possible consequences of a gap between what is done in the classroom regarding mathematical word problem solving and what research shows to be effective in this particular field of study. Data from the first phase of our study on teachers’ self-proclaimed practices showed that one-third of elementary teachers from the region of Quebec require their students to follow a specific sequential problem-solving method, known as the ‘what I know, what I look for’ method. These results led us to hypothesize that the observed gap may have an impact on students’ comprehension of mathematical word problems. The use of this particular method was the foundation for us to study, in the second phase, the effect of the imposition of this sequential method on students’ literal and inferential understanding of word problems. A total of 278 fourth graders (9–10 years old) solved mathematical word problems followed by a test to assess their understanding of the word problems they had just solved. The results suggest that the use of this problem solving method does not seem to improve or impair students’ understanding. From a more fundamental point of view, our study led us to the conclusion that the way word problem solving is addressed in the mathematics classroom, through sequential and inflexible methods, does not help students develop their word problem solving competence.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematical knowledge involving whole number multiplication and division is integral to understanding multiplicative structures such as ratios, slope, rate of change, and proportions, which are important in subsequent mathematical learning. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a research-based intervention, schema-based instruction (SBI), to teach multiplicative whole number word-problem solving to three-fifth-grade students with mathematics disabilities. SBI emphasizes the underlying mathematical problem structure, uses visual-schematic diagrams to show how quantities in a problem are related, focuses on problem solving procedures grounded in reasoning, and highlights metacognitive strategy knowledge to monitor and reflect on the problem-solving process. We used a multiple probe across participants design to evaluate the functional relation between the SBI intervention and word-problem solving performance. Immediately following treatment as well as 1–3 weeks later, results indicated acquisition and retention of word problem-solving skills by all three students. In addition, the percentage of student use of representations (i.e., drawing a diagram, writing a number sentence) increased from the baseline to the intervention phases. These findings and their relation to theory, research, and practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Two different tools for assessing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of mathematics teachers used in the framework of the COACTIV study are systematically compared in this paper, namely the paper-and-pencil test consisting of items on the three facets knowledge of explaining and representation, knowledge of student thinking and typical mistakes, and knowledge of the potential of mathematical tasks, and the video vignettes instrument that examines teachers' proposed continuations for presented lesson video clips specific to their subject-related and methodological competence aspects. Initially, both COACTIV PCK assessment tools are systematically contrasted for the first time with respect to their predictive validity for instructional quality (N = 163 German secondary mathematics teachers) as well as student learning gains (N = 3806 PISA students from 169 different classes) by means of path models showing that PCK, when assessed by the paper-and-pencil method, can better predict instructional quality than the video vignettes instrument can. Next, we theoretically propose the cascade model as capable of integrating pertinent theories on teacher competence and instructional quality. This model implies five ‘columns’ that are ordered according to a sequential causal chain (teacher disposition → situation-specific skills → observable teaching behavior → student mediation → learning gains). Finally, we specify four out of the five ‘columns’ of this cascade model, based empirically on the COACTIV data.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>We address measurement error bias in propensity score (PS) analysis due to covariates that are latent variables. In the setting where latent covariate X is measured via multiple error-prone items W, PS analysis using several proxies for X—the W items themselves, a summary score (mean/sum of the items), or the conventional factor score (i.e., predicted value of X based on the measurement model)—often results in biased estimation of the causal effect because balancing the proxy (between exposure conditions) does not balance X. We propose an improved proxy: the conditional mean of X given the combination of W, the observed covariates Z, and exposure A, denoted [math]. The theoretical support is that balancing [math] (e.g., via weighting or matching) implies balancing the mean of X. For a latent X, we estimate [math] by the inclusive factor score (iFS)—predicted value of X from a structural equation model that captures the joint distribution of [math] given Z. Simulation shows that PS analysis using the iFS substantially improves balance on the first five moments of X and reduces bias in the estimated causal effect. Hence, within the proxy variables approach, we recommend this proxy over existing ones. We connect this proxy method to known results about valid weighting/matching functions. We illustrate the method in handling latent covariates when estimating the effect of out-of-school suspension on risk of later police arrests using National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Affirmative action was banned in California, Texas, Washington, and Florida in the 1990s. Following this early wave, additional states banned the practice, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma. In response to concerns about underrepresented minorities’ falling college enrollment in flagship public universities, administrators and policymakers took a variety of steps to mitigate these declines. This article assesses the long-run changes in the racial and ethnic composition of selected universities after these bans. We find that the elimination of affirmative action has led to persistent declines in the share of underrepresented minorities among students admitted to and enrolling in public flagship universities in these states. These results imply that alternative policies and administrative decisions were unable to fully replace race-based affirmative action. Furthermore, we show that the antecedent conditions have only modestly improved in recent decades, suggesting that policymakers and administrators need to focus on improving these conditions.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing body of research evaluates the effects of turnaround on chronically low-performing schools. We extend this literature by formally testing factors that may either mediate or suppress the effects of two turnaround initiatives in Tennessee: the Achievement School District (ASD) and local Innovation Zones (iZones). Using difference-in-differences models within a mediational framework, we find that hiring effective teachers and principals partially explains positive iZone effects. In the ASD, high levels of teacher turnover suppress potential positive effects. Also, in iZone schools, increased levels of student mobility and chronic absenteeism suppress potentially larger positive effects. Policies that increase capacity within turnaround schools, such as financial incentives for effective staff, appear to be important ingredients for realizing positive effects from turnaround reforms.

Web usage data reveal that the commentary surrounding video posted to the VLC is sparse and surface level, possibly indicating a lack of serious attention to the videos. Interview data, however, indicate that participants felt they learned from this resource. Participants reported that the videos provided them with the opportunity to view and reflect on model lessons, plan curricula, and consider student thinking, among other learning outcomes. Participants also identified key factors that prevented them from posting comments to the site to convey their learning. These results can be used to understand not only how teachers perceive their own learning from classroom video, but also to redesign online professional development experiences to promote expression of that learning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study we investigated the development of 245 kindergarteners’ mathematics problem solving (MPS) at two time points within 7 months using a cognitive diagnostic test, which measured three cognitive components (mathematical knowledge and skills, semantic understanding, and quantitative reasoning) with eleven cognitive attributes. The effects of five influencing factors [language ability, mathematics application ability, calculation ability, approaches to learning (ATL) and socio-economic status (SES)] on the children’s MPS ability at the two time points were examined. The results indicated that the 245 children’s mastery of mathematical knowledge and skills was much better than their mastery of semantic understanding and quantitative reasoning. Furthermore, they achieved significant progress in set comparison and addition and subtraction within the range of natural numbers to ten (two of the three cognitive attributes of mathematical knowledge and skills), additive composition reasoning and one-to-many correspondence reasoning (two of the three cognitive attributes of quantitative reasoning). Only their mathematics application ability significantly predicted their mastery of the three cognitive components of MPS ability at the two-time points. Their language and calculation abilities predicted only their mastery of mathematical knowledge and skills at the two time points. Their ATL predicted their mastery of the three cognitive components of MPS only at the first time point, and their SES predicted only their mastery of semantic understanding 7 months later.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Language plays an important role in word problem solving. Accordingly, the language in which a word problem is presented could affect its solution process. In particular, East-Asian, non-alphabetic languages are assumed to provide specific benefits for mathematics compared to Indo-European, alphabetic languages. By analyzing students’ eye movements in a cross-linguistic comparative study, we analyzed word problem solving processes in Chinese and German. 72 German and 67 Taiwanese undergraduate students solved PISA word problems in their own language. Results showed differences in eye movements of students, between the two languages. Moreover, independent cluster analyses revealed three clusters of reading patterns based on eye movements in both languages. Corresponding reading patterns emerged in both languages that were similarly and significantly associated with performance and motivational-affective variables. They explained more variance among students in these variables than between the languages alone. Our analyses show that eye movements of students during reading differ between the two languages, but very similar reading patterns exist in both languages. This result supports the assumption that the language alone is not a sufficient explanation for differences in students’ mathematical achievement, but that reading patterns are more strongly related to performance.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Pictorial representations are often used to help children understand the situation described in a given number-sentence scheme. These static pictorial problems essentially attempt to depict a dynamic situation (e.g., one bird flies away while there are three birds still sitting on the fence). Previous research suggested that such pictorial decrease problems impose higher cognitive load on children than the corresponding increase problems, even though both are solved with addition. However, the source of this cognitive load is unclear. It could be the direction of the depicted change or the position of the unknown (start vs. end set). To address this question and disentangle the sources of the load, we presented the problems in two different formats: (1) the conventional static one-picture problems and, (2) an adapted three-picture problem-format, which depicted the dynamic change in sequential steps. We also examined whether the three-picture problem-format makes the decrease problems easier. Seventy-nine first-graders participated in this study. Results showed that, overall, problems with the position of the unknown at the end were easier to solve than the ones in which the unknown was at the start. Furthermore, three-picture decrease problems with the unknown in the last position were easier than the one-picture decrease problems, and therefore appear to be a meaningful way to make such problems easier for children to understand.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Informal strategies reflecting the representation of a situation described in an arithmetic word problem mediate students’ solving processes. When the informal strategies are inefficient, teaching students to make way for more efficient ways to find the solution is an important educational issue in mathematics. The current paper presents a pedagogical design for arithmetic word problem solving, which is part of a first-grade arithmetic intervention (ACE). The curriculum was designed to promote adaptive expertise among students through semantic analysis and recoding, which would lead students to favor the more adequate solving strategy when several options are available. We describe the ways in which students were taught to engage in a semantic analysis of the problem, and the representational tools used to favor this conceptual change. Within the word problem solving curriculum, informal and formal solving strategies corresponding to the different formats of the same arithmetic operation, were comparatively studied. The performance and strategies used by students were assessed, revealing a greater use of formal arithmetic strategies among ACE classes. Our findings illustrate a promising path for going past informal strategies on arithmetic word problem solving.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This research addressed Hungarian pre-service and in-service (both elementary and lower secondary) teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge concerning the teaching of word problem solving strategies. By means of a standardized interview protocol, participants (N = 30) were asked about their judgement on the difficulty of teaching word problems, the factors they find difficult, and their current teaching practice. Furthermore, based on a comparative analysis of Eastern European textbooks, we tested how teachers’ current beliefs and views relate to the word problem solving algorithm described in elementary textbooks. The results suggest that in the teachers’ opinion, explicit teaching of a step-by-step algorithm is feasible and desirable as early as in the 1st school grade. According to our results, two approaches (namely, paradigmatic- and narrative-oriented) concerning how to teach the process of word problems solving, originally revealed by Chapman, were found. Furthermore, teachers in general agreed with the approach taken in the textbooks on the subject of what kinds of word problems should be used, and that explicit teaching of word problem solving strategies should be introduced by using simple, routine word problems as examples.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The aim of this study was to investigate how pictorial representations with different semiotic characteristics affect additive word problem solving by kindergartners. The focus of the study is on three categories of additive problems (change problems, combine problems and equalize problems) and on representational pictures with different semiotic characteristics: (a) pictures in which the problem quantities are represented in pictorial form, that is, as groups of illustrated objects (PP pictures), (b) pictures in which the quantities are represented partly in pictorial form and in symbolic form (PS pictures), and (c) pictures in which the quantities are represented in symbolic form (SS pictures). Data were collected from 63 kindergartners using a paper-and-pencil test. Results showed that the semiotic characteristics of representational pictures had a strong and significant effect on performance. Children’s performance was higher in the problems with PP pictures but declined in the problems with PS and SS pictures. However, the differences in children’s performance across the problems with different representational format varied between the problem categories and their mathematical structures. The semiotic characteristics of representational pictures had an important role in the establishment of close relations between children’s solutions in problems in different categories. Detailed analysis of children’s answers to the problems revealed a number of picture-related difficulties. Findings are discussed and directions for future research are drawn considering the methodological limitations of the study.</p>
