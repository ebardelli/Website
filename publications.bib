	Abstract = {Prior work suggests that recent graduates from teacher education programs feel better prepared to teach and are more instructionally effective when they learned to teach with more instructionally effective cooperating teachers. However, we do not know if these relationships are causal. Even if they are, we do not know if it is possible to recruit cooperating teachers who are, on average, significantly more effective than those currently serving. This paper describes an innovative strategy to use historical administrative data on teachers to recommend the most instructionally effective teachers in various districts and subject areas to serve as cooperating teachers. In collaboration with a large teacher education program, partnering districts were randomized to receive either recommendation lists or use business-as-usual approaches. Those districts that received recommendations recruited significantly and meaningfully more effective and experienced cooperating teachers. Additionally, preservice student teachers who learned to teach in these same districts felt significantly better prepared to teach. This study offers an innovative and low-cost strategy for recruiting effective and experienced cooperating teachers and presents some of the first evidence that learning to teach with instructionally effective cooperating teachers has a causal impact on feelings of preparedness to teach.},

	Abstract = {Value-added (VA) scores signal teacher quality and are designed to be used, with other data, to make employment decisions. However, this usefulness is hampered by: 1) their normative nature, which promotes competition among teachers, 2) their difficulty to interpret and incorporate with other data, which makes using VA scores as one data source among many difficult, and 3) a lack of trust in scores. We show how to create (model-based) non-normative and more interpretable VA scores, which winds up being a simple rescaling of traditional VA scores. Our approach more closely links VA scores to data-based decision making efforts and enables the creation of clear and objective criterion of effectiveness for teachers.},

	Abstract = {There is growing interest in the field of education for leveraging emerging digital technologies to support teachers' learning in online or blended settings. This paper builds on Clarke and Hollingsworth's (2002) Interconnected Model of Professional Growth by investigating an alternative instantiation of professional experimentation. In particular, we examine the StoryCircles model of professional development (Herbst & Milewski, 2018), which ushers teachers into a simulated type of professional experimentation to support teacher growth through the design and improvement of lessons using storyboards. In that context, we investigate how StoryCircles enable teachers to experiment professionally in a virtual space. Focusing on the experiences of two secondary mathematics teachers, we illustrate how the StoryCircles processes of scripting and argumentation were associated with teacher growth. We discuss how Interconnected Model of Professional Growth can be useful for the design and study of simulated professional experimentation.},

	Abstract = {Improving the skill set of new teachers is a potentially important policy lever to increase student achievement. There are, however, doubts about the extent to which teacher education programs contribute to the development of teachers' skills. In this paper, we describe findings from an experiment designed to test whether one aspect of teacher education -- the assignment of teacher candidates to student teaching internships -- has a causal impact on the type of coaching they receive and their feelings of preparedness to teach. Specifically, we use administrative data on potential student teaching placements to predict those placements more likely to be promising, and then we randomly assign teacher candidates from one large program from Tennessee into either more promising (high index) or less promising (low index) internships. Based on data from a post-student teaching survey, we find consistently strong evidence of large effects of being assigned to high versus low index placements, particularly in terms of teacher candidates' perceptions of the quality of instruction of their cooperating teachers and the quantity and quality of the coaching that they received. And while not as large or consistently significant, we also found that teacher candidates in high versus low placements are more likely to report better working conditions in their placement schools, higher quality collaboration among teachers, more opportunities to learn to teach, and feeling better prepared to teach. Our findings provide evidence that teacher education can have a causal effect on the development of teacher candidates and it offers practical implications for programs and districts about how to use administrative data to inform internship placement decisions.},

	Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that preservice candidates receive better coaching and are more instructionally effective when they are mentored by more instructionally effective cooperating teachers (CTs). Yet, teacher education program leaders indicate it is difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs, in part because they worry that serving may negatively impact district evaluation scores. Using a unique dataset on over 4,500 CTs, we compare evaluation scores during years these teachers served as CTs to years they did not. In years they served as CTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat better achievement gains, though not always at significant levels. These results suggest that concerns over lowered evaluations should not prevent teachers from serving as CTs.},
