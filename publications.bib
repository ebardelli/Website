  abstract = {For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages in high-needs areas (HNAs), including science, mathematics, and special education, as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit HNA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee, we observe that the number of teachers who receive HNA endorsements has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNA teachers have similar student achievement gains as non-HNA teachers. Though HNA and non-HNA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM and special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Overall, findings suggest that efforts in Tennessee to recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with HNA endorsements have mostly been successful.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that preservice candidates receive better coaching and are more instructionally effective when they are mentored by more instructionally effective cooperating teachers (CTs). Yet teacher education program leaders indicate it can be difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs, in part because teachers worry that serving may negatively impact district evaluation scores. Using a unique data set on over 4,500 CTs, we compare evaluation scores during years these teachers served as CTs with years they did not. In years they served as CTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat better achievement gains, though not always at significant levels. These results suggest that concerns over lowered evaluations should not prevent teachers from serving as CTs.},

  abstract = {Prior work suggests that recent graduates from teacher education programs
feel better prepared to teach and are more instructionally effective when
they learned to teach with more instructionally effective cooperating
teachers. However, we do not know if these relationships are causal. Even
if they are, we do not know if it is possible to recruit cooperating
teachers who are, on average, significantly more effective than those
currently serving. This paper describes an innovative strategy to use
historical administrative on teachers to recommend the most
instructionally effective teachers in various districts and subject areas
to serve as cooperating teachers. In collaboration with a large teacher
education program, partnering districts were randomized to receive either
recommendation lists or use business-as-usual approaches. Those districts
that received recommendations recruited significantly and meaningfully
more effective and experienced cooperating teachers. Additionally,
preservice student teachers who learned to teach in these same districts
felt significantly better prepared to teach. This study offers an
innovative and low-cost strategy for recruiting effective and experienced
cooperating teachers and presents some of the first evidence that learning
to teach with instructionally effective cooperating teachers has a causal
impact on feelings of preparedness to teach.},

  abstract = {Value-added (VA) scores signal teacher quality and are designed to be
used, with other data, to make employment decisions. However, this
usefulness is hampered by: 1) their normative nature, which promotes
competition among teachers, 2) their difficulty to interpret and
incorporate with other data, which makes using VA scores as one data
source among many difficult, and 3) a lack of trust in scores. We show how
to create (model-based) non-normative and more interpretable VA scores,
which winds up being a simple rescaling of traditional VA scores. Our
approach more closely links VA scores to data-based decision making
efforts and enables the creation of clear and objective criterion of
effectiveness for teachers.},
